## 🚀 How It Works  

The project workflow consists of several key steps designed to deliver a comprehensive and actionable investment strategy:  

1. **Data Upload & Preprocessing**  
   Users upload a `.csv` file containing financial data. The system processes the dataset by:  
   - Validating and cleaning the data.  
   - Normalizing features for better anomaly detection.  
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values.  

2. **Anomaly Detection & Analysis**  
   The model identifies irregularities in financial performance using anomaly detection techniques. Key insights include:  
   - **Best Performance Period**: The timeframe with the highest returns.  
   - **Worst Performance Period**: The timeframe with the lowest returns.  
   - **Total Anomalies Detected**: The number of irregularities found in the data.  

3. **Strategy Report Generation**  
   A detailed report is generated, including metrics such as:  
   - Final investment value.  
   - Strategy effectiveness score.  
   - Recommended next steps for investors.  
   Users can download this report in a user-friendly format for further analysis.  

4. **Interactive AI Chat**  
   Users can ask questions about the report in an integrated chat. The **Gemini model** ensures accurate and report-specific answers.  

5. **Downloadable Strategy Results**  
   The system provides a downloadable file containing the calculated strategy results for offline reference.
